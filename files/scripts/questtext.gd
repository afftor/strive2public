Without any sort of proper greeting she bursts out at you. \n\n[color=yellow]— I demand you return my sister! [/color]\n\nA girl in her twenties of lower status, glares at you with a confident and intimidating look. After a brief explanation, you realize she means Emily, the girl you took off the streets couple of days ago. Despite her clear enmity, she looks fairly attractive, with long auburn hair and gray eyes resembling her sister's. Judging by her looks, she probably works in one of the shops or another service job. She is clearly not rich, but not as badly off as those from the orphanage. As Emily is brought to you, Tisha's face shows a sign of relief.\n\n[color=yellow]— What did you think when you came here?! You don't know what these people are capable of![/color]\n\n"

[/color]\n\nRegardless of her sister's agitations, Emily doesn't flinch.\n\n[color=aqua]— No. I'm not going back to the orphanage! I can stay here, if I want to. You don't even show up once a week and all I am left with is to beg in the streets when we don't have enough to eat. I’m staying here with $name. [/color]\n\nTisha reacts with surprise, but there's some determination left in her.[color=yellow]— Look, I know you have it tough, but so do I. You are my sister and I been working additional jobs to get us enough money to live on. Some that require me to sleep at work.

I'll let people in town know what you did! I have many friends and you'll pay for this if you won't release her![/color]\n\nEven though obviously enraged, Tisha’s threats do not sound too convincing.

var TishaEmilyCompensation = "You let Tisha know, that taking care of Emily wasn't free and you demand compensation for her time spent with you. She looks disgusted, but obviously prepared to offer such a concession. As Emily leaves the room, she approaches you closely. \n\n[color=yellow]— You must have planned this from the very beginning. It this what you want? [/color]\n\nSaying this she crouches and roughly pull down your pants, revealing your manhood. In response you order her not to rush. Tisha understands her position and it seems this isn't new for her; to make a bargain by providing someone with pleasure. She got what she wanted and now it was her turn to pay back. Even though she clearly despises you, her face is mostly resigned, making you wonder how many times she’s had to solve her problems this way. \n\nWith a few confident strokes your penis stands ready and you order Tisha to go for it. In spite of having no interest, she has some skills and pretty face. Her tongue elegantly moves up and down your shaft, while she uses her hands to stimulate you to a quicker orgasm. Despite her hope to end this soon, you take a good ten minutes to enjoy her mouth to its full. \n\nShe swears, as you finally come over her face. You give her some spare clothes and time to clean up before leaving, after which both sisters leave without looking back. " 
var TishaEmilyBrandCompensation = "Due to branding, Emily can be considered your property. You offer Tisha the only obvious solution for her: serve you instead of Emily. Giving her few minutes to think, you order Emily away. Finally, Tisha sees no other choice, but to make deal with you. Before that, however, you decide it would be best for her to submit to you right here, so you order her to give you a blowjob. \n\n[color=yellow]— You must have planned this from the very beginning, you bastard...[/color]\n\nSaying this she crouches and roughly pull down your pants, revealing your manhood.

Despite her hope to end this soon, you take a good ten minutes to enjoy her mouth to its full. \n\nAfter sprouting over Tisha's face and listening to her grunts, you decide this does not exactly satisfy you yet and order her to take off her clothes. After going this far she realizes there's no choice but to go with your demands. Under your stare the older sister reveals her voluptuous body, while still covering her privates and heavily blushing, indicating a plentitude of shame she has left. \n\nAfter savoring the look, you order Tisha to bend over the table, which she reluctantly does. Her striptease was enough to make your cock hard again. You spot her being somewhat wet as you hastily push into her pussy. Surprised by sudden entrance the girl yelps under your weight. Her tight cunt feels just right for you, and as you proceed to move she also gets wetter. Realizing, that this won't be over quickly, Tisha attempts to enjoy this intercourse by closing her eyes and quietly moaning in response to your thrusts. You decide it might be a good idea to build a relationship with your new toy sooner, rather than later. You help the girl to achieve orgasm together with you, as you pull out and cover her ass and back with your semen. \n\nAs Tisha lies breathless, you decide it's a best time to secure your new possession and perform the branding ritual over her, to which she patiently submits."

var TishaEmilyKeepEmily = "You realize, as both sisters are in your possession, there's ultimately no reason (other than reputation), to go with your words and lose any of them. As you declare it, they stare at you in disbelief.\n\n[color=yellow]— No way... You tricked me!? I knew all you rich bastards were like this! [/color]\n\nIt is probably a good idea to keep a close eye on them over the next few weeks."
var EmilyReturn = "In the morning you are surprised by a visit from an old acquaintance - Emily, who seems happy to see you. She briefly explains herself:\n\n[color=yellow]— I talked to my sister and she finally agreed to let me work for you. I guess she thought that if you were going to do something bad with me, you'd done it already, so..."
var EmilyMeet = "In the corner of the street you spot a young girl dressed in ragged clothes. Poverty is widespread about the kingdom, but seeing it first hand still raises some discomfort in you. It does not look like there's many people around, nor anyone paying attention to you, so you decide to start a conversation with her. \n\n[color=yellow]— I'm sorry if I bother you, $sir, but I'm very hungry! Could you spare some food?[/color]"
var EmilyFeed = "After going through your belongings you finally find some bread and meat you had leftover from breakfast, which you pass to her. Emily takes your offering with an excited look and quickly expresses her gratitude. While she eats, you decide to spend some time with her and ask about her life, deciding it could be useful to get a better understanding of the city. \n\n[color=yellow]— I've been living in the orphanage since before I can remember... I have a sister but she left a few years ago. She now tries to earn some money for us to live on so we rarely see each other anymore. Oh, m-my name is Emily... [/color]"
var EmilyTake = "You explain to Emily how you recently moved in and could use some help around the mansion. You can provide her with food and shelter if she won't mind following your orders.

I'll do my best![/color]\n\nSealing an agreement, you give Emily directions to your mansion and she leaves. "

Seemingly unaware of your plans, Emily disappears into the bathroom. \n\nA quarter of an hour later, you, being sure, that the aphrodisiac should've taken effect, take a small peek. With a grin, you discover Emily sitting naked on the board, red in the face, squeezing her thighs while her fingers explores her privates. Quickly undressing yourself, you slip into the bathroom unnoticed, and approach Emily playing innocent. \n\n[color=yellow]— $master! I'm not…[/color]\n\nThe orphan girl seems to be completely shocked at your unannounced presence, her face getting even redder. Judging by the fact she is not screaming or trying to escape, you decide, that she can't make up her mind on how to react, and quickly take things into your own hands. With a gentle, yet accusing voice, you tell her, that you appreciate her arousal, but she can't just do what she pleases in her $master's home. Catching Emily in your trap, you make her believe that her behavior is entirely her own will and her lust is based off of her desires.\n\nSeeing Emily accepting your manipulative words, you wrap your arm about her in an embrace, meeting no resistance. Despite being overwhelmed by the new situation, the aphrodisiac pumps through her veins and the orphan girl begins to awkwardly respond to your actions. As you greedily suck on her month, your hand hastily covers her soaking crotch, joining her own hand. With small push, Emily shyly spreads her legs apart, giving you easier access. Stimulating her pussy, you slide a finger into her to discover she's clearly still a virgin, although that possibility had  already crossed your mind. \n\nAs she gets wetter and her moans get louder, you lay her on the bench and without further delay push your erect cock inside. The brief look of pain on her face is quickly washed away by pleasure as you begin to move within her. With every push the look on her face becomes more and more blissful, as she leans forward  trying to hug you. A few moments later she orgasms and feeling of her convulsions lead you to your own climax, filling her with hot seed. As you pull out, a stream of semen mixed with blood slowly seeps from her hard-breathing body. \n\nAfter helping her clean up, you leave the bathroom and get dressed once more.A few minutes later, she emerges from the bathroom red faced. She averts her eyes as you look at her, but as you don't spot any negative feelings towards you. You leave her to get accustomed with her new role. "
var EmilyShowerRape = "After few minutes, you noticed that Emily is finished with shower and is preparing to get dressed. You rush into the dressing room and roughly push her against the wall. Shocked by your entrance, Emily tries to protest, but your hand closes over her mouth. While your other hand lecherously savours her body, you let her know, that even if she yells, nobody is going to come to her rescue, and her resistance will only make things worse. Tears begin to swell up in her eyes, but her attitude quickly reveals she understands her position.\n\nWith her acceptance, you decide to make the most of this little affair and grab her small boobs squeezing them forcefully. Pulling on her nipples with clear intent to cause some pain, you delightly listen to small cries and observe her pained expression. Holding her squirming body, you push into her pussy, quickly meeting the resistance of her hymen. Pausing before you break through you roughly rub her. Despite her pleading she begins to gets mildly wet at your administrations, which makes you grin. \n\nYou bend her over and push her against the wall. Emily sobs seemingly preparing for what she knows comes next. \n\n[color=yellow]— Please stop, I don’t want this![/color]\n\nGrabbing her ass, you force your hard cock inside her virgin pussy in one thrust making her cry out in pain, as it tears through the slight resistance of her hymen. You pause, giving her barely enough time to recover, before resuming without any further concern for her well-being. Since she's not going to enjoy it anyway, you decide it's only humane to focus on your objective. Accompanied by her sobs and cries, you mercilessly fuck her tight pussy until you finally climax deep inside of her torn privates. \n\nLeaving her sobbing on the floor, your come mixed with blood oozing from her abused pussy, you advice her to take another shower. Satisfied you make your way out of bathroom."
var EmilyMansion = "After returning back you spot Emily seemingly struck in awe over your possession. Deciding her looks are not quite suitable for your establishment, you instruct her to freshen up and find something suitable in the wardrobe. \n\n[color=yellow]— Ah!

var EmilyMansion2 = "After an hour a renewed Emily finds you. It seems she managed to find something right for her size and with some side help even managed to fix her appearance.

I'm sorry, but I think Tisha is gone. I was visiting her yesterday, but she wasn't at her workplace. Her boss said she's been missing for two days and nobody really can tell where she is. If it won't bother you, please help me find her, I hope nothing bad happened to her.

var TishaDisappearAgree = "[color=yellow]— Thank you, $master, I knew you would help me out![/color]\n\nEmily looks greatly relieved by your words and gives you information on where Tisha lives and works. Apparently she was employed by the Order in last few days before her disappearance.  "
var TishaDisappearDeny = "You tell Emily that you are a busy person and she'd better ask for city guards to help with that. Although chances of them helping out someone like her are very slim. Emily retreats with a sore look and leaves you to your business. "
var TishaDisappearUnlock = "You tell Emily that this kind of stuff might be very dangerous, and putting yourself into trouble for someone you barely know is not very beneficial to you. As she is about to despair, you pretend to consider helping her and finally tell her, that you might be able to help, if you get something from her in return. Emily gives you a troubled look, but after long pause her worrying gets better of her. \n\n[color=yellow]— Alright, I will trust you. I'll do what you ask if it will help Tisha.

He doesn’t bother to hide his irritation with you, and only shares what little he knows when it’s clear you won’t leave him in peace.\n\n[color=yellow]— Ah, that girl? Haven't seen her since yesterday morning. She was assigned to register newcomers. No idea what she's thinking about since she was only hired recently. Yeah, she also got a place in the dorms, you could try check that out, I suppose. She’s missed two shifts now, so if you do see her tell her she’s fired.

var TishaDorms = "The Order's dorms are tidy and bright, albeit fairly crowded. To your mild surprise, there are quite a few non-humans, who apparently are employed for the less reputable jobs. After getting to Tisha's room, you find an elven girl in the hallway who appears to be her neighbour. After trying to get any useful information out of her, you realize that she evidently knows something. However, she she also seems quite nervous about actually explaining anything."

I didn't think anything could really happen to her, I told him about her daily routine and when she comes back, and I thought he might be some sort of admirer of hers, or even flirting with me... But then she didn't came back and I thought she might be hanging out with him... I was afraid that I would be held responsible for her disappearance. Please, I meant her no harm!

You decide it would be the best to check local town's watch for possible suspects.

His reluctance to answer is soon cured by your threat to turn him over to the city's watch. \n\n[color=yellow]— Damn you... Fine, I was hired to kidnap a few local pretties. She fit the bill and was an easy target since she was running around town all the time. I don't really know who the guy was, but he had couple guards with him, so probably a merchant.

She resides in dark, medium sized cell, and judging from the spark in her eye, hasn’t lost her spirit yet. It’s easy to admire her composure as she probably contemplating how it would be possible for her to break free later on. \n\nAt first, she doesn’t recognize you, but soon realization strikes her and she looks at you with shock and surprise. Whatever she might think of seeing you here, the gag in her mouth prevents her from sharing. You still have to buy her way out, so you decide not to show that you know, or are even interested in her since that would just drive up the price.The guide still suspects something, though. \n\n[color=yellow]— This one is still rough around the edges, so I'd only recommend her to experienced owners, but probably you wouldn't have too many troubles with her. Still she's quite attractive and uncommon for these lands, so naturally price will be hefty. 800 gold at minimum.

While still being impaled, she moves her face down to give you another long sloppy kiss, as her pelvis slightly grinds against yours. \n\nTisha finally starts moving up and down on your shaft. As her tits sway gorgeously before your eyes, you decide to give them support while teasing her delicate nipples with your hands. Even though she does not look very experienced in that, you can clearly see Tisha trying her best and enjoying greatly by your affair, moaning with each move and yelping at your pinches. In less than minute you can clearly see how she lost in pleasure and her rising gasps and cries lose any sort of pattern. \n\nAs her actions become wilder and wilder, you can't help but move closer to orgasm. Finally, as she lets out her highest cry, her convulsions bring you to orgasm, filling her thirsty womb with your seed.

var TishaEmilySex = "Having sufficiently developed both girls' sexuality you come up with the idea to pair the two sisters and test if they are open to  new fascinating experiences. \n\nFirst you talk to Tisha and propose to her an interesting game to you’d like to try: she'll have to have sex with another girl while the two of them are blindfolded. You will be the judge and whomever shows the most enthusiasm, will get a reward of their choice. Although Tisha is somewhat reluctant at first, she eventually accepts your proposal after hearing how she might get to take a whole week off from work with Emily. After getting her agreement, you approach Emily for the same proposal. She quickly agrees with a hint of excitement at trying something new. \n\nYou choose a dark room with a spacious bed and vape it with some mild aphrodisiac intoxicating incenses. After preparing both girls in separate  rooms, you lead the blindfolded Tisha to the bed and make her wait, before leading a naked Emily to her. Both girls, already free of clothes slowly begin to explore each others bodies with their hands. Tisha, being the more assertive of the two, upon realizing her partner is a little more timid and slightly smaller, takes the leading role and pulls her sister in closer for a deep kiss. As their mouths passionately merge, Emily, notices that the initiative is being taken away from her, tries to take it back by clumsily attacking her sister's crotch with her fingers. \n\nThe room quickly fills with pants and the heat of two siblings attempting to unknowingly please you. After you feel both girls are consumed by their act, you give them a sign indicating Tisha to lay down. After positioning Emily between Tisha’s legs in a position to  give oral, you for a moment consider to joining in the action, but decide it's too risky, and if everything goes to plan, you will have access to both sisters at any time. While the younger sister timidly attempts to lick Tisha's already very moist orifice, you prepare an additional toy. \n\nYou briefly take Emily away from her sister's cunt to quickly equip her with a double ended strap-on. She makes an almost soundless moan as you insert the one end into her pussy. After giving her few moments to adjust  to the new sensation, you help her to press it against Tisha's already prepared pussy and give her ass an inspirational slap. The older sister, figuring out your plans, tries her best to be an active participant despite being on the receiving end and helps guide the dildo with her hands. Finally, Emily thrusts her hips forward causing her sister to gasp in response as the dildo slides into her. \n\nWithout taking too long, the younger sister quickly learns to use the new artificial organ to fuck Tisha's pussy. On the receiving end Tisha embraces her partner with all she can, both locking her legs behind her back and occasionally bringing her head up for a smooch. Upon seeing Emily on the verge of orgasm, you carefully take off her blindfold and gesture for her to keep quiet. As Emily's lust filled eyes adjust to the situation and the person before her. She takes only moments to accept the fact, that she's doing it with not just anyone, but her sister. \n\nAfter giving Emily some time to build up to her previous pace, you direct Tisha to sit face-to-face with Emily while still being connected by the dildo. You give Emily an order to continuously kiss her sister, while you wait for the right moment. As Tisha becomes seemingly lost in her sister's mouth and they both near climax, you pull the blindfold from Tisha’s head revealing her partner.

I know, this is a bit improper, I'm glad we have the chance to get even closer now. [/color]\n\nHearing her sister’s praise and enjoyment of their coupling Tisha seems to have no response.

They start peppering you with stories of how their farms are being raided by a group of bandits that seems to have taken residence in the area.

He seems a little nervous to be talking to a mage, but answers you.\n\n[color=yellow]—Well, $sir, my granddaughter Tia was out picking berries in the wilds yesterday and she didn’t come home like she was supposed to. When I went out to go look for her, I found her basket but there was no sign of her. Please $sir, with all the recent attacks I’m worried that she got taken by a group of bandits.

You see $name quickly sneak up to where the bandits left their mugs, adding something to each. As $he disappears back into the forest you admire $his skilled woodcraft, startled when $he pops up behind you.

After you tell her this, she nods slowly and hesitantly offers to tell you what she overheard.\n\n[color=yellow]—I’m not sure how much help this is, but I heard one of the bandits talking about about a slaver camp in the crossroads. They mentioned that their boss went off to explain to the slaver why they didn’t have the wolf-girl they promised to deliver. Some of the bandits were worried that the boss would kill them if they didn’t come up with enough loot by the time he got back and hoped he would be distracted by me. That’s...that’s all I know.

He walks off sadly while the rest of the village buys you a round of drinks at the bar, asking you to retell the story over and over. Finally, one of the men approaches you with a small bag of gold.\n\n[color=yellow]—Here, It’s not much, but we all pitched in. Thank you for getting rid of those bandits for us.[/color]\n\nWhen you open the bag and see the measly 50 gold you think to yourself that taking the girl was the right move.

var CaliVillageEnter3 = "As you enter the village of Shaliq, there’s an immediate cheer when you’re spotted. Apparently they’ve already heard what happened from the girl you rescued. Not much of a surprise there since you just dropped her off at the inn before you went of. Suddenly, you’re almost knocked off your feet by a very enthusiastic hug - more a tackle, to be honest. You realize it’s the girl you rescued and see her grandfather beaming at you.\n\n[color=yellow]—I can’t thank you enough for what you’ve done. Tia told us everything. I can’t believe you and your companion managed to take out more than twice your own numbers in bandits, let alone save my granddaughter in the process.

Finally one of the burly men from the crowd speaks up.\n\n[color=yellow]—That’s downright generous of you $sir.

Since you killed the other bandits, you tell her that your only hope of finding more information on where she was taken from is to infiltrate the camp and try to get close to the bandits’ boss.\n\n[color=yellow]—Ya know, there might be a way I could help you get in.

She wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea, but agreed as long as you made her bindings loose enough that she could slip out of them quickly.\n\nUpon seeing the half-kin girl one of the sentries smirks, while the other starts looking bored again.

Alright, show her to the boss. — He jerks a thumb behind him. — Look for the red tent near the center of the encampment.[/color]\n\nYou notice Cali bristling at the dismissive tone and shoot her a warning look before thanking the guard and heading in. Despite its small size, the encampment is crowded with tents and cages. You can hear the sounds of whips and screams in the background and you can see Cali’s eyes widen as she sees a pair of half-kin catgirls naked and covered in welts in a one of the nearby cages.\n\nYou finally manage to locate the red tent the guard mentioned and walk inside. You are immediately greeted by the sight of a corpulent man dressed in gaudy clothes, scribbling on some papers at a table.\n\n[color=red]— What is it? I told you not to bother me again today![/color]\n\nHe doesn’t bother looking up. Clearing your throat, you try to get the man’s attention.

There’s tents and cages throughout the cramped space and the sound of whips, cursing and screams fill the air. The smell isn’t exactly pleasant either and a quick glimpse at one of the cages shows one of the reasons. Inside is a young half-kin girl, huddled in a fetal position and covered in her own filth. Other cages have more of the same, the few occupants that dare meet your eyes look at you with fear.\n\nYou finally manage to locate the red tent the guard mentioned and walk inside.

Even though you’d warned Cali you might do this, she still seems a bit worried. Your trip through the camp must have made an impression on her.\n\nThe man steps closer, ponderously making his way around her. After a minute or two he nods to himself.\n\n[color=red]— Well, she’s not much to look at. She seems like she has some spirit in her though, that might make her entertaining to break. If you want to sell her I suppose I could offer 350 gold for her.[/color]\n\nYou find yourself surprisingly tempted by the offer.

She apparently never noticed the knot you tied was actually a slipknot, and your yank simultaneously draws the bindings tight and knocks her off balance. The slaver just watches with interest as you quickly subdue the struggling wolf-girl. After she’s been thoroughly hog-tied you tell the slaver to keep a close eye on her and that she’s already escaped from one set of captors before. The slaver just smiles, an evil glint in his eye as he replies.\n\n[color=red]— Oh, trust me, I know just how to deal with a girl like her. First I’ll spend some time beating her so she knows her place, then I’ll pass her around to be raped a few times. If any of my men aren’t pleased, she’ll be beaten again. Of course if it looks like she’s too badly injured, I’ll just have to heal her. After a few days she’ll be begging to please every man in the camp.[/color]\n\nAfter you heard the man mention he’d heal her, you instinctively looked to see if the man was wearing a distinctive ring.

You explain that you had recently been by Shaliq village, where you overheard an interesting tidbit in the local inn. Over the next several minutes you weave together a convincing story that the residents of  Shaliq had caught several members of a bandit gang that had been raiding nearby farmsteads, and after questioning them they had claimed to be working for him.\n\n[color=red]— What!? That’s ridiculous. I never ordered any attacks on farms, and I certainly have no interest in dealing with human girls.[/color]\n\nAfter you explain that the captured bandits said their leader was supposedly here now making some kind of deal with him, his eyes widen in realization, then narrow in anger.\n\n[color=red]— That incompetent bastard. First he fails to deliver on his quota, now he pulls this shit down on me!? I’ll have his balls in a vice for this.[/color]\n\nYou offer a solution, that if he tell you where you can find the bandit, you’ll take care of the problem for him.

He thinks about it for a minute, beedy eyes narrowed in thought then nods.\n\n[color=red]— That sounds like it would work. Of course if I find a lynch mob from Shaliq coming my way I’ll make sure you suffer for it. How about I give you a discount on buying slaves from me in the future? I’ll also give you a token to let the guards know you’re trusted here.[/color]\n\nYou act as though you’re considering the offer, then accept. He tell you where you can find the bandit’s leader, just a short ways into the woods. As you exit the tent, Cali give you a look of admiration for your artful deception, and after you’re past the guards she pumps her fist.\n\n[color=yellow]— Yes! I can’t believe you pulled that off [Playername], that was awesome!

Seeing his interest, you explain that you found out about his operation by overhearing some talk in Shaliq Village, and that he may have a problem on his hands.\n\n[color=red]— What do you mean I have a problem?[/color]\n\nDespite his obvious irritation, your serious tone seems to have caught his attention. You explain that you had recently been by Shaliq village, where you overheard an interesting tidbit in the local inn. Over the next several minutes you weave together a convincing story that the residents of  Shaliq had caught several members of a bandit gang that had been raiding nearby farmsteads, and after questioning them they had claimed to be working for him.\n\n[color=red]— What!? That’s ridiculous. I never ordered any attacks on farms, and I certainly have no interest in kidnapping little human girls.[/color]\n\nAfter you explain that the captured bandits said their leader was supposedly here now making some kind of deal with him, his eyes widen in realization, then narrow in anger.\n\n[color=red]— That incompetent bastard. First he fails to deliver on his quota, now he pulls this shit down on me!? I’ll have his balls in a vice for this.[/color]\n\nYou offer a solution, that if he tell you where you can find the bandit, you’ll take care of the problem for him. Provided, of course, he offers you some considerations in the future. You explain your plan, yet another layer to the deception, and wait for his answer. He thinks about it for a minute, beedy eyes narrowed in thought then nods.\n\n[color=red]— That sounds like it would work. Of course if I find a lynch mob from Shaliq coming my way I’ll make sure you suffer for it. How about I give you a discount on buying slaves from me in the future? I’ll also give you a token to let the guards know you’re trusted here.[/color]\n\nYou act as though you’re considering the offer, then accept. He tell you where you can find the bandit’s leader, just a short ways into the woods.\n\n[color=red]— Make sure to stop back after you’ve handled that problem for me. I’ll cut you a good deal on a new pet.[/color]"

Is...is anyone here?[/color]\n\nThe reason for Cali’s frightened voice and shocked expression is pretty clear. Just within the clearing lay the burned-out wreckage of what used to be a small home. Knowing what she’s likely to find, you slowly walk around the clearing while Cali frantically pulls at the burnt timbers. You aren’t surprised when your exploration of the clearing reveals a pair of corpses. One is that of a male beastkin wolf, while the other is a human woman. You sigh, then call out to Cali. As she comes up to where you’re examining the bodies, her eyes widen.\n\n[color=yellow]— Oh no...I…I was too late. Why? I tried so hard, they...they can’t really be dead can they?[/color]"

var CaliStay = "You tell her that that’s fine and that she can stay with you for as long as she wants. She gives you a grateful look, then scrubs her eyes.\n\nAfter several hours you bury her parents and return to the mansion. It may not have been a happy conclusion, but Cali seems to appreciate what you’ve done for her. After the death of her parents, she seems to have lost some of her confidence and assertiveness, but her faith in you has grown a lot and she seems willing to do whatever you ask of her."
var CaliSlave = "You think for a while, while Cali seems to grow more nervous. Finally you tell her that if she is willing to swear absolute servitude to you, you’ll consider it. If she promises that she will be obedient, won’t cause any trouble and will do anything you ask of her, you will offer her a place in your household. She swallows, then nods.[color=yellow]— I’ll be a good servant...$master.[/color]\n\nIt may not have been a happy conclusion, but Cali seems to understand her place. After the death of her parents, she seems to have lost some of her confidence and assertiveness becoming more passive that she used to be.

var CaliPlaythingSuccess = "You finger the Amnesia Potion you found in the bandit leader’s camp, then withdraw it. You tell Cali that if the pain is too much to bear, there’s something she could do.

From the beginning I guess I was just going to end up as someone’s plaything. I’d rather it be you than someone else. Just...promise you won’t throw me away.[/color]\n\nYou nod and Cali takes the potion from you. Closing her eyes she drinks the potion down in a rush. As she opens her eyes, the empty bottle slips from her fingers to the grass below. Her empty eyes and blank expression are all you need to confirm the impact of the potion.\n\n[color=yellow]— Who are you?[/color]\n\nYou explain that you are her Master and that she belongs to you.\n\n[color=yellow]— What are we doing here Master?[/color]Smiling, you take her hand and lead her away from the corpses. While you walk, you explain that you brought her out here to explain her her duties and teach her what pleases you. After you are a ways away, you tell her to remove her clothing, to which she immediately complies. As she stands naked before you, you tell her her sole purpose in life is to bring you pleasure with her body. For the next several hours you instruct her in how to pleasure you with her hands and mouth, with her pussy and her ass, until her body is stained in your semen and your seed trickles down her thighs. \n\nCali is left a broken mess, more animal than human. Nothing remains of her old personality and all she knows is how to serve her master with her body."
var CaliPlaythingFailure = "She looks at you in shock and revulsion.\n\n[color=yellow]— My parents are dead and you...you want me to become your plaything?[/color]\n\nWithout another word she takes off, never looking back. You shrug as she disappears into the woods. It’s a shame, but she was never that loyal to begin with. You poke around the ruins for time, hoping to find something the bandits left behind. Pocketing the few trinkets you happen across, you return to your mansion."
var CaliLeave = "You look around the scene. The burned house, the dead bodies of her parents and the half-kin girl you spent all this effort for. At that moment you decide it. That’s it. You’re done. You did what you said you would and helped Cali find her parents. It’s not your fault they’re dead and you’ve wasted enough time and effort already. Without saying another word, you leave the girl to her own devices. She can be a thief or a whore for all you care. All you know is that your part in this is over."
var CaliGoodEnd = "As you approach a clearing in the forest you come across a lone house. Apparently Cali has been already spotted by her parents as two figures left the build and rushing to the returning girl. A beastkin male and human female with which Cali share some resemblances. \n\n[color=aqua]— Cali! You’re alive, thank the gods! We thought we’d lost you.[/color]\n\nAs they finally gather and reach each other, the three of them share a long hug. After they part, the man looks at you, then back to Cali.\n\n[color=aqua]— So Cali, who’s this person?[/color]\n\nCali looks over at you and grins, tail wagging furiously.\n\n[color=yellow]Mom, Dad, this is $name. He’s been letting me stay at his mansion and he helped me find my way back.[/color]\n\nThe man and woman both give you an appraising look. After a moment, the woman raises an eyebrow and looks at Cali.\n\n[color=green]— So you’ve been taking care of our daughter? I hope she hasn’t been too much trouble.[/color]\n\nYou assure her that Cali’s been fine, and proceed to explain all that’s happened while Cali was missing. Both of her parents seems impressed, and pleased that you managed to help her find her way home.\n\n[color=aqua]— That’s quite the tale. Escaping from slavers, being rescued from the city guards, then this young fellow managed to track us down after taking out an entire gang of bandits. Not to mention getting here just in the nick of time. Is there anything we can do to repay you?[/color]"
var CaliGoodEndNoReward = "You shake your head and explain that you were just keeping your promise. Seeing Cali reunited with her family is reward enough. Her parents seem impressed with your probity and tell you that if there’s anything their family can do for you in the future, all you need to do is ask. You leave Cali and her family to clean up from the bandit’s attack and feel a sense of satisfaction from a good deed accomplished. "
var CaliGoodEndNoRewardReturn = "It’s been a week since you returned Cali to her parents, and as you settle in for the night you think about the young half-kin girl. Sure, she might not have been the most beautiful girl you’ve met, but she was brave, hardworking and outspoken, traits that are all too uncommon. Suddenly you hear a bit of a commotion from downstairs. You head down, then blink in surprise.\n\n[color=yellow]— Um...hi $name. I was wondering, well...It’s just...I mean, I talked to my parents about it and...Argh! Why is this so hard![/color]Cali takes a deep breath then meets your eyes squarely.\n\n[color=yellow]— I think I love you, $name and I want to stay with you. I don’t mind being your servant, or even your slave. I know I’m not very experienced, but I’ll do anything you ask me to. I’ll fight for you, or gather food or...or bear children for you. Please...just let me stay with you.[/color]\n\nYou smile and ruffle the hair on Cali’s head. You’re glad she’s back and tell her so. As Cali follows you back up to your room, you grin. After all, she did say she’d do anything."
var CaliGoodEndReward = "You tell Cali’s parents that if they really want to reward you, anything would be fine. After all, you were mainly doing this as a favor to Cali. It’s not like you expected a reward. After some consultation amongst themselves Cali’s mother goes into the house. A few minutes later she returns.\n\n[color=green]— I know it’s not much after what you’ve gone through, but here.[/color]\n\nShe hands you a small case. Inside is a number of carefully labeled potions.\n\n[color=green]— My father was an alchemist and he left me with a number of useful potions. Maybe these can be of use to you.[/color]\n\nYou thank her, and give Cali’s hair a ruffle. When you get home, you’ll take a look, but for now you just say your goodbyes. Cali and her mother both give you hugs, while her father shakes your hand and promises never to forget what you’ve done for them. When you eventually return to your mansion you inspect the potions Cali’s mother gave you. You can tell a couple of them are expired, but there’s actually a rather good assortment. There’s a couple of stimulant potions, three tonics of hair growth, an elixir of youth and perhaps most impressive, a potion of oblivion. You’ll miss having Cali around, but are pleased that you could manage to keep your promise to her."
var CaliGoodEndKeep = "You think to yourself for a while. You’re happy that Cali was reunited with her family, but will miss having her services in the mansion. Despite her snark, she was actually pretty useful to have around. Nodding to yourself you ask if they would mind if Cali continued to work for you. If she’s willing, you promise that you’ll let her visit whenever she wants.\n\n[color=aqua]— Well Cali, it’s up to you. What do you think?[/color]\n\nCali looks at her parents then shrugs.\n\n[color=yellow]— I don’t mind working for $name, I mean, that’s what I was doing before anyway. And, well, I guess I do owe $him for all this.[/color]\n\nShe turns to you and gives you a wink.\n\n[color=yellow]— Let me just spend some time catching up with my parents and I’ll come back to the mansion, kay? I know you’ve probably got some [/color][color=pink]work[/color][color=yellow] for me to do when I get back[/color]\n\nCheeky brat. She actually wanted to come back and that wink and look she gave you tells you just what sort of “work” she has on her mind. A few hours after your return, Cali shows up at the door.\n\n[color=yellow]— Hey, I’m back and I’m ready to do whatever you want me to...$master.[/color]"
var CaliProposal = "As you are about to move to the bed, you spot Cali near your room, who apparently was waiting for you. She looks rather nervous but after seeing you, she seems to gather her courage and approaches you. \n\n[color=yellow]— H-hey, I've been waiting for you. I wanted to thank you for taking care of me and also not letting that guy at the bar do anything to me. I never did anything like that with anyone, and that was kinda scary when he asked for it. I mean, I want to try it someday, but not like that... [/color]\n\nCali suddenly becomes quiet with her face getting redder as you observe her. Finally she finds the right words.\n\n[color=yellow]— I actually wanted to say, that I've been thinking a lot about you lately, $name. There wasn't anyone who cared for me like you, besides my parents. I think, I really like you, and... well...[/color]\n\nYou can't help but appreciate her boldness despite how obviously ashamed she is. You decide that it's a time to stop the girl torturing herself over you."
var CaliAcceptProposal = "You tilt your head forward due to Cali's small stature and connect your lips to hers, giving her, her first adult kiss. As your lips touch, her ears twitch and pupils widen, until she decides to close her eyes. While gently savoring her delicate mouth, you decide that at this point it would be better to move into your bedroom. You give Cali a small sign and the wolfgirl obediently enters your chambers. You close the door behind her, to make sure nobody will interrupt your intimacy.\n\n[color=yellow]— Wow, that's a huge bed. I think my mom and dad's was smaller at home. Oh, sorry, sometimes I get distracted easily. Um... what should I do... $master?[/color]\n\nAn unusual, submissive word from Cali makes you smirk at the thought of her trying to please you. As you sit down on the bed, you motion the wolfgirl to join you. She readily complies moving towards you. Sitting next to each other you take initiative and return to what you recently stopped on the other side of the door. As you gently ease your tongue into her mouth, Cali awkwardly tries to accustom to the new experience. As she passively responds back to your kisses, you begin to strip her clothes from her.\n\nAs her body becomes exposed, Cali blushes even harder, which quite contrasts with her usual cheeky attitude. Noticing you closely inspecting her, wolfgirl meekly speaks.\n\n[color=yellow]— Uhm... sorry, for not being much to look at. [/color]\n\nRealizing, that she mistook your actions, you quickly reassure her, that you are quite happy with her form. Trusting your words, she succumbs as you push young girl down and go over her chest with your mouth. Cali puts up minor resistance by putting her hands over your head as you tease and gently bite the aroused nipples of her nearly flat chest. As she begin to acclimatise to the new sensations, her breathing gets accompanied by meek moans. You attempt to place your hand over her crotch only to realize it's been covered by her bushy tail. Getting past that, you confirm she's already wet. After pushing her tail aside and taking a look at her tight virgin slit, as she dazedly watches you inspect her, you decide that it's time.\n\n"
var CaliProposalSexMale = "After preemptively warning her, you pull out your already rock-hard cock, which she observes in awe, and position it over her pussy. As you take her hands into yours and take in her face, she gives you a broad, ready smile. Taking the opportunity you forcefully penetrate her in one quick thrust. With her hymen torn, her incredibly tight pussy willingly takes your cock inside eased by its wetness. Cali's pained cry briefly fills the room, calming down as your minor pain-absorption spell makes her feel better. While still connected, you hug and kiss the wolfgirl to which she reacts almost blissfully. After explaining to her that you’re going to move now, and getting a confirming nod back, you begin to slowly move in and out of her tight hole. \n\nAlmost forgetting about the recent pain, Cali seems to focus on you and your movements, trying to adapt her little body to your pushes. The wolfgirl's pussy seems to be getting better at taking your cock with each thrust making her moan in pleasure. Each thrust feels like you’re shaping her recently virgin slit into your new personal hole. As pleasure overwhelms her, you set yourself to trying to cum in unison, increasing your speed almost neglecting her small stature. Finally feeling the approaching orgasm, you seal her lips with one last passionate smooch. As you fill her womb with your hot seed, you can feel her inner walls tightly spasm around you due to her own climax. After couple of moments lying breathless on Cali, you finally pull out letting seed flow from her.\n\n[color=yellow]— I'm really glad you was my first, $name. That felt amazing... can we do it again some other time?[/color]\n\nShe looks a bit puzzled as you laugh in response, but still hugs and affectionately kisses you. Still naked you both fall asleep. "
var CaliDenyProposal = "You give Cali's head a gentle pat and say, that you also like her and you will be watching out for her, until her parents are found. She shows relief, but you can spot a disappointed tone in her reaction."

Bet you are disappointed, hehe, but I'm part of the establishment. You want to know more about fairies like me? They are fairly rare and expensive. If captured from the wild, they require complex training to be able to serve on par with other slaves, so usually rich people buy them for their exotic value. I've been educated and trained since very young age, so I guess that would make me pretty expensive! *giggles*\n\n— Yeah.. you could try your luck outside near the elven and far parts of the local forest.

How do you feel about travelling to one of the hotter regions? We received a request for help from the Orc's capital, Gorn. \n\n— Apparently, there's some local disputes we have been asked to solve by one of the councils in government. Surely, you should be able to take care of that. Just one suggestion, try to keep low profile and not disclose who you are while working on it. Not everyone is happy to have the Order directly involved in what they consider their own business. When you get there, look for orc named Garthor from the Sorgul clan.

[/color]\n\nThe Orc gives you brief summary regarding a large dark elf clan called Kel'tor located to the east, and while nominally neutral to Gorn, has recently been taken control of by ambitious young elf with unclear motives named Ivran. His informant however suggests, that Ivran is potentially very dangerous and the recent course of Kel'tor seems to suggest more aggression towards the surrounding areas. In either case Garthor wants you to capture and bring him in for interrogation. After that a decision will be need to be made on what to do with him. Infiltration of their lands won't likely bear any fruit as they are extremely suspect of strangers. \n\nYou are given a full estimated schedule of Ivran and it's clear that capturing him around evening on the hunting fields which he regularly visits might be the only option to catch him with the fewest guards possible.

var MainQuestGornIvranFind = "After some time scouting you manage to spot Ivran resting in a camp surrounded by his men after the hunt. The dark skinned elven male has a very slender, almost feminine figure and somewhat delicate face, making you wonder how valuable he might be if not for situation.

He seems quite pleased with your work and tells you to return in few days, once they have managed to get some information out of your captive. "
var MainQuestGornPalaceReturn = "You make your way back to Garthor, who apparently has been waiting for your arrival. After a brief greeting, he tells you that Ivran was planning to begin actively moving against Gorn's government and were in position to attack the city.

Even if you brainwash him, he might recover his memories and try rejoin his clan creating even more problems in the long run.

She is still quite lean and undeniably attractive. Without knowing who she was, it would be very hard to draw the connection between two.

So you are the one who took care of that issue. The letter told me you are looking into ways to take care of Ivran and want me to provide assistance with making him... harmless. I guess, I can provide you with one, unconventional method. You could turn him into a gal, I heard he's already somewhat of effeminate looks, so you will get yourself a new plaything. This is not your average body modification however, and the effects won't be reversible. Dark elven clans are strict and patriarchal, so even if he was able to prove that he's their old leader, it's nearly guaranteed they won't follow after him. That should be sufficient for your plans?\n\n— I will want you to help me out first though. I gather you have enough connections and power to provide me with a part-time worker?

With your recent accomplishments and dedication I would rather entrust it to you, than another.\n\n— Are you familiar with Amberguard? It's an old elven town located to the East of Wimborn. Unlike many of the wandering elves you might have seen about, those who live there prefer to have a little to do with us as possible. However, they do still obey and follow the rules of  the Order so you should not encounter any problems travelling  there. They probably won't act very friendly, Be that as it may, I believe you will manage.\n\n— A short distance North of Amberguard, you will find one of the entrances to an old  underground tunnel system. The entrance was sealed away by the elves hundreds of years ago. An informant of mine reports that the entrance appears to have been sealed in haste and it is very likely that there may be ancient relics as well as documents containing important and valuable knowledge left behind in those tunnels.\n\n— As you might have guessed, outwardly your mission seems pretty straight forward when put into words, heh. Find a way into those tunnels, find out what’s in them and bring back whatever you find. \n\n— It’s going to be harder than that though. Those tunnels were sealed for a reason, what that is I don’t know but I expect it could be rather dangerous, so I would take as many combat capable escorts as I could if I were you. \n\n— See you later, Oh and  $name, keep this mission and whatever you find on the down-low for now.[/color] "
var MainQuestGornMelissaAfter = "On your way out of building, you hear your name. As you turn around, a sharply dressed man approaches you. He introduces himself as David.\n\n[color=yellow]— I’m a member of Internal Affairs with the Mage Order. We are based in the Capital and are responsible for dealing with all problematic matters that arising involving members of the Order, as well as those that might affect them. I’d like to ask you a few questions please.[/color]\n\nHe inquires if you have any knowledge of or heard any rumors regarding an individual named Hade. Quickly picking up on your confused look  he gives you a brief summary of the subject. In recent months there  have been a number of  rumors regarding  an individual calling himself Hade, who has been interfering in guild business and we believe attempting to recruiting members of order. Outside of few unexplained deaths and disappearances suspected to be linked to him there is almost nothing to go on. Moreover, the Senate does not believe that anyone would be able to, or have the audacity to willingly disrupt or even oppose the entire Order so they discard those reports as meaningless rumors as there simply is not sufficient evidence to prove anything.\n\nWith that, he expresses his respect for your hard work and dedication, as well as congratulating you on  your recent achievements and quick promotions. He asks you  to contact him should you come across any information or encounter something suspicious that may be related to Hade. After leaving you with his coordinates and a reminder that Hade is potentially a rather dangerous individual, David disappears into the ancillary portal room."

var MainQuestAmberguardSearch = "After spending few hours reading through reports and documents in the town's archives and hall you only succeed in ruining your own mood: even though locals allow you access to almost everywhere, they go out of their way to be as unhelpful as possible. Nearly giving up and needing a break  you stroll around the town trying to clear your head. A call out from a side alley brings you to a sudden halt. A lean looking man stands in the shadows.\n\nBeckoning for you to come over he makes you an offer. He might know someone who knows how to enter the tunnels but it’s going to cost you for the information.\n\n[color=yellow]— You look like the type of person who can afford it. 1000 gold and the information is all yours. You’re not going to get help from any of the other locals, that’s for sure.[/color]"
var MainQuestAmberguardReturn = "A quick search of the backstreets you find the lean man who offered to assist you before. He requests 1000 gold for the information he has."
var MainQuestAmberguardPay = "After double checking your payment, the stranger tells you of a hermit witch that lives outside of Amberguard. The local villagers occasionally visit her for supernatural help and if anyone around here knows anything about what’s behind that seal it would be her. After giving you clear directions on how to find her, he hastily retreats down the alleyway secreting the pouch of money beneath his clothing."
var MainQuestAmberguardWitch = "Following the directions given, you reach a lone wooden cabin nestled in a clearing. After confirming you’re where you think you should be and unsure of what to expect you slowly make your approach.

You’re welcome to visit, as long as you were not planning to sneak in that is.[/color]\n\nShe looks over at you quizzically. \n\n[color=yellow]— Come on in and tell me what brought you all the way out here, mage. [/color]"
var MainQuestAmberguardTunnelsAsk = "[color=yellow]— Hmmm... a dangerous place. From what I have learnt within the tunnels used to be a human city, which was destroyed during the events of the Great War, now all that is left are ruins. Maybe some magic experiment went out of control, maybe destructive elven magic. Not gonna make blind assumptions, but I'd imagine tens of thousands died and were left there. On top of that, leftover magic has polluted much of the area.. \n\n— I believe at some point, it became so bad, they decided to seal whole thing underground. It was most likely too late though and some of the pollution affected the surrounding areas. You should be familiar with what sort of things happen around magic pollution. I've tried to find more info about it, but the Order seems to have patiently cleaned up everything after war ended and access to a lot of information is restricted. Not surprising given your usual pedantry on the subject. [/color]"
var MainQuestAmberguardTunnelEnterAsk = "[color=yellow]— So you want to explore those ruins? Yes, I know how to get in. Locals avoid going near the place, buncha scaredy cats if you ask me.  I would however ask you for favor in return. \n\n— Since you seem to be a rather skilled mage it shouldn’t be too difficult for you to get me a couple slaves? I'm mostly interested in using them for my experiments. Mostly... I want you to bring me one elf and one drow. I am studying the differences between them and it's hard to find willing folks for my experiments. That, and drow are simply not common in these parts. \n\n— Bring me both and I'll get you underground. [/color]"
var MainQuestAmberguardSlaveDeliver = "[color=yellow]— Alright, I'll take those. Now I'll tell you how to get in. \n\n— Yeah, there's no point trying to unseal main entrance, since that would require a lot of effort and there are simpler ways to get in. Many creatures have tunneled holes to get in and out, not to mention there are a number of caves that have openings. I'll tell you how to get there, but be prepared, I don't think there is much in there that  wouldn't try cut or bite your face off around that place. [/color]"

As you relay your findings she eagerly listens to every word.\n\n[color=yellow]— An ancient golem, didn’t think there were any left? I’m impressed you were able to deal with it. The Order used to produce golems in the past. From what I understand, they proved to be far too costly and the process too complicated to use for mass production. The parts required to produce them along with the skill to craft materials sufficiently susceptible to magic manipulation were beyond the ability of all but a few Arcanesmiths And that’s just to create the body itself, and does not even take into account creation of a level of sapience so they could be automated. \n\n— After the War was over, the need for golems was reduced and the skill to craft them was mostly forgotten. It was simpler, cheaper and quicker to train people on as regular guards. There was little need for highly specialised and powerful guards. \n\n— Anyway, give me a week or so to look through these papers and see what mysteries they hold. And thank you again, you’ve far exceeded my expectations in this regard.[/color]"

I've received a message from the Capital. The Main Order has requested  you meet them regarding some business they are not willing to disclose in letter. You'll have to deal with them before I can give you any new assignments, so don't waste too much time.[/color]\n\nAfter receiving the invitation paper and a teleport pass, you leave Melissa and make your way to the central hall.

var MainQuestFrostfordMainOrder = "Stepping through the teleporter, you appear in the main headquarters of Mage's Order. Although it is more grand than the Wimborn one you are familiar with, the atmosphere feels surprisingly similar: multiple people rushing around with various gadgets and documents. After talking to the guards, you are directed to one of the higher floors where it seems to be quieter with fewer goings on. You can almost feel the power and potential that you might achieve here. Finally locating the parlor you've been summoned to, you enter after a knock. \n\nThe spacious room with multiple seats and tables is quite unlike what you might've expected from the higher echelons of the Order. This room seems to be more like any of the others, albeit a slightly more extravagant looking clerk workplace, a common theme for the Mage's Order: efficiency and asceticism always takes priority. Multiple seats are taken by eccentric looking people of whom, not all appear to be human. \n\nUpon your entrance about half of them switch their attention to you and silence descends on the room. After you give a brief introduction, one of the leaders, a senile looking man's face brightens and he addresses one of his colleagues. \n\n[color=yellow]— Oh, right, he is the one we would have deal with that one issue... Ellen, could you give a summary to our guest?[/color]\n\nAn elf woman with unusually aged eyes rises up and after giving a slightly contempt look at the old man, addresses you. \n\n[color=aqua]— We of the council greet you, $name. Recently we have heard news of your achievements within your local branch and from your mentor. The Mage's Order has always respected resourceful people and from our information you have... [/color]\n\nHer speech is interrupted by a groan from the previous speaker, indicating that she should get to the business. \n\n[color=yellow]— It has come to our attention that one of our neighbouring regions is experiencing hardships of an unknown and potentially dangerous origin. Frostford has requested our help in dealing with some sort of new disease. Their government hopes to keep incident under cover to prevent unnecessary panic and to try prevent the possibility of it spreading to new victims. We believe, that with your experience travelling and dealing with other races, not mention your skill in the magic arts, you are well suited to this task. \n\nHer introduction speech is cut short by the same old man, who seems to be the informal leader. \n\n[color=aqua]— This is not an opportunity you would get from your local guild, a chance to show your true potential around here, kid. Silently take care of Frostford's problem and you will prove your worth around here, easy, right?[/color]\n\nJudging from little you could put together, the task at hand will be anything but easy. You can't help but admire the manner in which the old man manipulates those about him. \n\n[color=aqua]— Now, give $him the papers and we can get back to those…[/color]\n\nYou weren't able to make out the last of his words as one of the orderlies guides you out, handing you your instructions and permissions. Having no further business at the capital, you return to Wimborn. "
var MainQuestFrostfordCityhall = "Upon arriving at the Frostford City Hall, you are greeted by a large male Beastkin of wolf origins, who introduces himself as Theron a current leader of the ruling clan. He informs you he has been waiting for you. \n\n[color=yellow]— I don't want to waste any time with niceties as my people are suffering at this moment, so I'll get straight to business. Recently some our hunters have been plagued by some unknown disease while they are out on assignments. They seem to experience a fever along with extreme pain due to... well their skin rotting. From what we can tell, it's does not seem to be contagious, at least nobody assisting them has shown any signs of being infected. You can see them, but I hope we can keep a low profile on this issue, while it does not seem to be a threat to others, we would rather not to cause worry or panic among the citizens. [/color]\n\nAfter taking notes from Theron on the issue, you make your way to the infirmary and are met by a horrendous smell. You look around all the while covering your nose. After spending half an hour inspecting the patients and talking to the medics it seems that the plague does not appear to be natural at all. The only lead you have points at them all having visited the same area located to the southwest, before coming down with this illness. Perhaps you should investigate that area with care."
var MainQuestFrostfordForest = "You enter into a forested area, quickly noticing something seems to be a bit off. After looking around for a few minutes you realize that the plants and trees are growing in what appears to be carefully chosen spots, as if planted by someone rather than naturally spreading, however there does not seem to be any indication of a settlement for miles around. You also take note of an increased animal population around having encountering more than usual. \n\nAs you progress deeper into the forest, you are stopped by an unfamiliar voice out of nowhere.\n\n[color=yellow]— That's enough stranger. These lands do not welcome just anyone, even if you do not pose a threat.[/color]\n\nWith that a female dryad steps out of the woods. She does not appear to be your usual dryad, but a powerful spirit governing this forest. You've heard old tales about spirits manifesting and growing very strong in places with no civilization, but finding one in this time and age would require one to venture into some very dangerous places far from civilization. One thing all those tales had in common, was that spirits are nothing like a normal person and can take on many aspects being harmful, beneficial or uncaring.\n\nYou explain the reason for your intrusion, but spirit shows little reaction to it.\n\n[color=yellow]— Those hunters have been punished for intruding and harming those within my domain. They killed animals, they cut trees for their camps and fires. They should be happy I haven't killed them all, since they showed no mercy here. You can tell them this. If new marauders continue to show up their curse will never weaken and end. [/color]\n\nUpon your suggestion that they probably had no idea they were entering an area they were not welcome and are used to hunting what they can catch, dryad grows irritated. \n\n[color=yellow]— Enough. If they really wished to be cured, they should've come of their own accord and begged for mercy, not sent someone else to fix their mistakes. This talk is over.[/color]\n\nThe spirit disappears into the thicket, leaving you with nothing else to do but to return to Theron and tell him everything."
var MainQuestFrostfordCityhallReturn = "After telling Theron about your encounter in the woods, Theron seems to become even more irritated, than the emotionless spirit you recently met.\n\n[color=yellow]— Why haven't you killed it?! I thought you were sent by the Order and are here to solve our problems! Just kill it, burn down the whole damn thing if need be, I'm sure the curse will be undone upon its death. You don't expect us to starve just because of some forest monster do you? [/color]\n\nHis extreme reaction, along with his demand  makes you to think that there's something more going on than just the cursed hunters, so you decide to ask why they even disturb those grounds. After a long silence, Theron opens to you,  and finally explains his problem. \n\n[color=yellow]— Since you've already agreed to look into our problem, I must respect your need to have as much information as we can give and trust you won't cause us any harm. These lands were gifted to us a long time ago but they are not very suitable for living. The coldness and constant snow makes most attempts at agriculture impossible. We have always been limited in our food resources and only managed to grow because of a constant supply of provisions, but we have to pay for it with hard labor, as nearby mountains hold rich resources in them which we can trade with. I don't even want to think what would happen if supplies stopped or if the Empire turned on us. We need new ways to sustain ourselves and that forest has what we need. We just can't pass up on a means to be more self sufficient.[/color]\n\nYou tell him, that you need to consider your options and leave the room."
var MainQuestFrostfordCityhallZoe = "After you leave the building, you hear someone calling you over. Turning around you see a richly clothed young wolfgirl seeking your attention. \n\n[color=yellow]— Wait up! I'm sorry but I've been eavesdropping your conversation with my uncle. Please, listen to me, there's been a huge mistake... [/color]\n\nYou decide to listen to girl's plea as she might have some useful information.\n\n[color=yellow]— My name is Zoe. I’ve heard some rumors about you around town... that you are a kind person. Please, excuse my uncle, he's concerned because he cares for the people and the clan, and with our region being remote we often get the feeling that there's very little to connect us to the Empire. \n\n— But I don't think attacking that spirit will solve anything. It might not even help the sick people. I'm sure if we just get rid of the spirit that area will become just like the other land about here or even die off. We can't sustain our population from hunting alone but nobody will listen to me. Let me come with you, I want to try to to talk to that forest spirit and maybe we can find a better solution…\n\nYou consider young girl's proposal, not sure if it would hurt or help the cause. Perhaps she could help find a solution that would be beneficial to both sides, on other hand if her uncle is willing to keep sending people to their deaths, you could still call off her uncle and recommend someone else take over leadership."

My father is deceased and with that it leaves me as nothing more than a bargaining tool for someone's arranged marriage at best, can't even leave on my own. I've tried to study and help with the town's issues but they won't accept what some “ignorant girl” would say. This way I can at least try to prove my worth... if they don't get too angry at me for escaping. [/color]\n\nFrom what Zoe tells you, it seems that clan has a very strong hierarchy and the chosen leaders and their close relatives are held in a higher respect. On top of that, women rarely take any leadership roles and thus they are often overlooked in that regard. You explain to her how things function in other places. She listens intently with a spark in her eyes. As the talk goes on you quickly find yourself closing in on your destination."
var MainQuestFrostfordForestReturnWithZoe = "Shortly after you approach the clearing with Zoe, the forest spirit shows up with mild look of curiosity on it's face. Zoe asks if you will let her talk to it, and after thinking for a moment you give her permission. After taking a couple of steps forward, she drops on her knees and begs to the spirit. \n\n[color=yellow]— We are greatly sorry for trespassing and attacking your creatures. If your majesty would allow this, I want to discuss our problematic situation. [/color]\n\nAfter couple more sentences showing Zoe's skills at negotiations and etiquette, spirit stops her.\n\n[color=aqua]— I might accept your apology, but if I find your words shallow, I'll execute you. If you agree to this, come join me. [/color]\n\nZoe gives you a worried look, but ultimately agrees and before disappearing into the bushes tells you to wait for her."

With the spirit's powers we will try to grow new crops, suitable for our lands. I will have to stay here and would ask you to do two things. Firstly, please explain to my uncle that there's no need to worry and that they shouldn't attack this place. I also promised to provide help if something bad happens here. Secondly, we will need some ingredients, I hope you could get them for us. Here's the list, until then we will be waiting for your return.

Few moments before the bolt reaches its target, Zoe, who spotted this slightly earlier than you, jumps in its way. \n\nQuickly dispatching the remaining enemies and putting out the fire, you rush to the spirit, who holds Zoes still breathing body. The bolt has plunged deeply into her chest and it's doubtful she would live for more than few hours even if it was just a common weapon. Zoe, getting paler by the moment does not even seem to have any strength to talk, looks up at you with fear in her eyes.\n\n[color=yellow]— A mighty venom. It takes a lot just to keep her conscious. You might try to save her, if you are brave enough. By using another person's life essence we can attempt to keep her alive while she recovers, but there's very little chance for them to survive the process. In the worst case they both will die.

The city has been surrounded, the elves moving in shortly after the first strikes. I've managed to send a messenger through their lines to the nearest town. Given how relentlessly they are proceeding with the siege, we may be able to hold out a few days at best. There's no doubt that this strike is retaliation for what we stole from them.\n\n…\n\nThey are relentless, most would have retreated and settled in for an extended siege by now but they keep throwing bodies at the wall. They must be desperate to retrieve our findings. This gives us hope that what we have is even more vital to our survival and we thought."
var AmberguardLog3 = "[center]Order Master Log[/center]\nAfter all the setbacks we have faced, we’ve finally done it. We have in our hands the solution to ending the war. The Thaumic Obstructor can easily affect an area roughly a square mile and is especially effective against those who are magically gifted targets. It's ironic, how they were the ones who designed this device. Once we get through scheme's encryption and defences, we'll be able to develop additional protection for ourselves and render whole squads of theirs ineffective.\n\nIt is clear enough that they are well aware that we were stole their schematics and are launching ferocious attacks against our outposts already. Thankfully we  prepared for such, and as a result they have suffered a great number of casualties. It is vital that we pass on our findings to the other members of the Order and to the rest of humanity. As long as we have enough time, we should be able to get word out. \n\nMiraculously our walls still stand. Reports from the walls report the elves have retreated back to a safe distance but still surround the city. I do not for one minute think this is over. Too much is at stake."

The air within is cool, a refreshing contrast from the heat outside.\n\nThis dimly lit bar can be at best categorized as something in-between a tavern and brothel. Despite its’ nature it is busy the long hall filled with seats and booths each partly separated with curtains. The bar plays hosts many strangers of all sorts, while small rooms at the back allow those who willing to pay a place to retire for a time. A few gals rush about serving and keeping customers company at the counter, perhaps offering additional services or just flirting."

Alchemy is just something I do so the Palace will play along with my demands and nobody pushes me around for not obeying the authority and traditions, marrying some imbecile because that's what dark elf women do, or whatever. \n\n— In case you were wondering, I'm actually far more interested in species researches. Life and sentience took very broad way to present itself and that has amused me for a very long time, so with some extra help I'm able to roam around and gather lots of information. Very few people actually care about things like history or how everything came to be as it is now, but at least some might find my works helpful in the future. [/color]"
var GornAydaTalkMonsters = "[color=yellow]— Oh yeah, I've been studying the less humanoid races and their behavior. It's nothing surprising really: people can only rise from community of other people. The more primitive the community, the less children are able to adapt, so in some cases even the ability to talk is a lot to ask. This is more a young brain's ability to learn much more at earlier stages, so a grown-up entity will have incredible hardships adapting to more complex society. \n\n— I've found only one solution to this - reverse an entity's mind back to its' very young stage, retrieving back the ability to adapt to new surroundings. This is not the most elegant solution, but if you really someone to be able to not freak out in a city, that will probably be your only solution. I can sell you the recipe, but that won't be cheap. \n\n— As for re-education I suggest you see the slaver's guild. As far as I know, they do have some specifically designed schools at least around human dominated cities.[/color]"

While her posture and movements show a lack of refinement, she has an appealing allure. Her short, cream colored fur, makes her stand out in the darkness of room.

[/color]\n\nAfter telling Yris your name, you inquire about her business here.\n\n[color=yellow]— Oh, this is just my kinda place. Interesting people come and go and the booze ain't bad either. But I get what you are wondering about. Sorry, I'm no hooker, even though many would love to be able to pay their way into my pants. *giggles* Providing sex for money is just plain boring, where’s the challenge in that, and you have to deal with all sorts of unpleasant people. I have spades of stories from an unfortunate friend. Instead, I only play with prey I like. [/color]\n\nWith that, Yris gives you an intriguing glance, lasting just long enough to make you slightly nervous.\n\n[color=yellow]— Speaking of playing, $name, you appear to be quite unlike most who come through here, aren't you? Do you like to gamble? I enjoy placing bets on things I can personally participate in. I’d like to suggest you one of my favorites.... We go somewhere nice and private, and if I make you cum by any means in under 5 minutes, I win. In that case, I take 200 gold from you. Otherwise, you get 200 gold from me, or you get to use me until you are satisfied. But beware, I'm pretty confident in my skills. *giggles*[/color]\n\nAfter a brief consideration weighing the odds, you feel that bet could go either way.. 200 gold for 5 minutes of action is probably 10 times too much, but as a gamble, it has a certain appeal.

var GornYrisAccept1 = "After you agree to the bet Yris nods to the barkeeper and he passes her a key to one of the private rooms. With an eager expression she leads you into the back room. After directing you to the large armchair, she takes couple minutes to prepare herself and returns back wearing only black, laced underwear, nicely contrasting against her light fur.\n\n[color=yellow]— Alright, here's our judge. [/color]\n\nShe puts a medium-sized hourglass over on the shelf. You notice, that it appears to have slightly more sand than might be usual for it’s size, but that is to be expected from the preparator. After seeing you are ready, the catgirl flips the hourglass over and kneels down before you, quickly exposing your penis. \n\nWith her soft, semi-furred hands, Yris firmly grasps your penis, bringing it to erection in mere seconds. With a brief smirk, she patiently starts rubbing your cock and testicles in all different ways all the while closely observing your reaction to each. Her ministrations are guided not only by her intuition, but also by her desire to win the bet. She is clearly trying her best to please you, and you can't help, but respect her skills, as her actions 'investigating' what makes you respond is already very pleasant on it's own. \n\nSoon she seems to be done with experimentations and with another brief smirk she quickly settles on a rhythm. You realize that Yris has worked out what is effective and now her hands tease your cock in just the right way slowly building up in speed. What was very pleasant on it's own before, now has become incredibly pleasurable.You quickly realize, that you need to resist if you want to have any chance at beating Yris and gather all your will to try stop your approaching orgasm, which briefly helps.\n\n[color=yellow]— He-he, you are quite an opponent. but we'll see if you can resist this... [/color]\n\nWith the built-up excitement spiking,she takes your cock into her mouth. The heat and dampness along with your already heightened arousal are quickly accompanied by Yris's rough cat-like tongue. With thirst she wraps her mouth and long rough tongue about your cock giving you no time or chance to get accustomed to the new sensation. After only few thrusts you can't help, but savour the climax overwhelming you, as she pulls out and let you cum over her face.\n\n[color=yellow]— Oh, what a rich smell... Well, looks like I won! [/color]\n\nAfter quick glance, you realize that sandglass is only half empty and you probably never stood a chance in first place. \n\n[color=yellow]— You held up pretty well too! Most guys blow before they get to even experience my mouth at all. I can see by your face, you enjoyed that didn't you? I wouldn't mind betting against you again, you know, so if you wanna have a second go sometime... *giggles*[/color]\n\nAfter Yris leaves with your money, you decide that second time will most likely play out in same way and trying to challenge her unprepared is fairly dangerous proposition for your wallet. Few minutes later you return to the bar counter."

var GornYrisAcceptRepeat = "After showing the cash, Yris takes you back into the same room as before. Knowing your weak spots she quickly brings you to orgasm and milks you dry. After taking your money, she bids you farewell and offers to meet again. You decide that you should probably be better prepared  if you wish to attempt her challenge another time."
var GornYrisAccept2 = "After Yris takes you to the same room once more and leaves you alone to prepare herself, you quickly gulp down the preemptively prepared Deterrent potion. Thankfully, as she returns, you begin to feel it's effects kicking in. \n\n[color=yellow]— I was almost worried I wouldn’t get a chance to enjoy your company again. You ready, sweetie? [/color]\n\nAfter flipping the hourglass, Yris jumps you with her usual passion. Quickly going through her previous steps you realize that her attack is much more resistable under the effects of the potion. Noticing your composure, she slowly switches to using her mouth. Her skill with her hands and mouth once again provide an incredible sensation, almost making you wish you had not taken the potion as its effect dampens the feeling. As you enjoy her mouth, her face starts to show mixed emotions of worry and growing arousal. \n\nYou pat her head as you notice, her hand periodically sliding into her panties to play with herself. Getting caught up in the action, you both nearly miss the sand in the hourglass running out.\n\nYris notices your smirk, she gives you a slightly troubled and shocked look as she spots the empty hourglass. \n\n[color=yellow]— Well... looks like you won, sweetie. What's your demand then? If you remember, we can continue, or…[/color]\n\nWithout letting her finish, you forcefully push her down and free her from the last of her clothing . Initially, you considered taking her money, but at this point  you can only think about fucking the catgirl in front of you. You see her eyes are also filled with desire, as you force her onto all fours and reveal her already moist pussy. \n\nPicking up on your intentions, Yris raises her hips eagerly offering herself to you, gasping as your hard cock penetrates her. Wasting no time, you grab her soft, fluffy ass and began thrusting in and out of her. With each move she cries out, enjoying every moment, begging you to fuck her harder. A few moments later her hole clenches tightly about your cock as she cums. Feeling your orgasm approaching as well, you don’t let up with your assault on her and pound her with increasing force, as you finally release your seed into her loins. \n\nAt last you collapse next to her as you both recover from your encounter. \n\n[color=yellow]— Wow.. not only you are prosperous, but also have a beasty temper. That was certainly makes up for the fact I lost. I would like to spend some more time together, but sadly, I gotta go. I won’t say no if you show up and challenge me again, sweetie. [/color]\n\nAfter giving you a gentle goodbye kiss, Yris gets dressed and leaves. As you prepare to leave yourself, you spot an object that has fallen behind the shelf. After picking it up and inspecting it, you realize that it's an ointment you haven't previously encountered. You quickly pocket the jar before leaving the room."
var GornYrisAydaReport = "You approach Ayda and ask her to take a look at the jar of ointment you found left behind in the back room. She takes the ointment from you and after few minutes returns with a report. \n\n[color=yellow]— Well it’s an interesting mixture. I’m pretty sure it’s a strong aphrodisiac laced with a tactile stimulant, but there is also something else special mixed in giving it a unique feel, probably pheromones. This appear to make you to your partner nearly irresistible for some time... Nothing dangerous from what I can tell, and since you have to apply it directly onto the target to be effective you can safely carrying it about., you wouldn't have any problems carrying it. As for your own skin, you could protect yourself from the effect with weak foundation. You can take some, there’s a half-empty bottle on the counter, if you need it.[/color]\n\nAfter a brief contemplation, you thank Ayda and take the foundation."
var GornYrisOffer2 = "You spot Yris seated at her usual place, but today she looks a little different.\n\n[color=yellow]— My favorite play partner is here! I'm really thrilled to see you after last time, you know... So since we both scored, how about we raise the odds? One thousand gold, 10 minutes to get you off. A little birdie told me that your pockets are a little deeper than you let on, so that shouldn’t be a problem for you? So, what do you think? Tempting, right?[/color]"

var GornYrisAccept3 = "Yris shines with confidence and grins hearing your answer. She eagerly escorts you away and proceeds to go through her normal procedures leaving you alone as she prepares.. You quickly apply the foundation you took from Ayda all over your groin, while gulping down another deterrent potion. A slightly larger hourglass is brought forth and after asking for your confirmation, Yris quickly gets to action. This time you spot, how her hands initially slightly moist, from what you had thought to be just water from the bathroom before. As things were proceed much like before, you notice how much more clearly you can think about the things  happening. Yris is still very attractive and skillful in her play, but the previously experienced urge to take her above any reason is gone. \n\nTo avoid raising any suspicion you act like you are constantly on the verge like before: after all this is a bet. Yris, now switches to her mouth and accompanies it with a titjob. While she eagerly works on your cock she keeps a nervous eye on the hourglass as the sand  gets lower and lower. Holding back takes some effort, but you expect you can hold out till the end.. \n\nAs the sand reaches around 1/4 of what is left in the hourglass, Yris gets even more nervous and hurriedly drops her panties, swinging her legs over she mounts you. You’re not completely sure if it's her own drugs doing,  her desperation to win, or if she simply gets horny easily, that drives her on as you are embraced by her wet pussy. You lay back into the armchair, as she moans sweetly while she begins to ride your cock in earnest. This pose brings about a new sensation, making it harder to hold back. Yris does not seem to have much experienced at this, but her effort greatly makes up for it, steadily bringing you closer to the edge. Thankfully, the sand runs out just a bit before you'd have to cum, making you think, that if she'd start with this, you could easily have lost. \n\nYris sits astride you, your cock still buried within her, as a deep red blush overtakes her,  unable to believe she has lost to you again. Despite her blushing her eyes show no fear.\n\n[color=yellow]— Wow... you beat me again. Are you going to fuck me like before?... [/color]\n\nDespite her suggestive question, you don't really feel like that would worth it."
var GornYrisReveal = "You reveal everything to Yris, the things you discovered and your preparations before the bet. She is both shocked and amazed by you at the same time. \n\n[color=yellow]— Who would've thought you would crack my secret and in so little time... and then turn the tables using my own tricks against me. Please don’t tell anyone, it will ruin my reputation and make it harder to get by, and a few people might try get back at me.\n\n— It's been a bit rough for me since I moved here. Getting work is also hard, especially when you look so out of place. I found that some people were only interested in me for my unusual looks. Others showed little interest or rejected me. Many of these were willing to take up the offer and despite their lack of feelings I was still able to make them ejaculate. \n\n— Actually, the first bet was offered to me, and I was on receiving side. I was taken away by how thrilling it was and from then decided to try pay my bills this way. This was both fun and enjoyable, even though I only offer it to those who I find attractive, many take up the offer. I also got into gambling, but cards and sport bets have nothing on this. Eventually, I found a way to make my chances more... secure. Since that mixture made the very few people, who won against me, too horny to ask me for the cash. There's no rules against anyone using anything, and they still agree that there's an option they might take, so nobody was disappointed. \n\n— Then, you showed up. The first time was just fun and you held out well, but then after the second time I thought I did not use enough ointment so you managed to win. After thinking it through, I thought that you'd be more confident after your last win at least for the next time and this could bring me a hefty prize. But I guess you outsmarted me in the end... Well, there was nothing about using side help in the rules, so that's only fair for me to accept your victory. \n\n— I'm sorry, I don't quite have the sum we were betting on, so I can't quite pay you back yet. I promise, I'll find some way to get the money, please just give me some time... [/color]"
var GornYrisTakeGold = "You tell Yris you would rather have the one thousand gold which has been bet.

var GornYrisHire = "You suggest Yris joins your household. With the money she owes you, this gives her a sound way to pay you back, plus since she already somewhat fond of you, this is not something terrible for her. After listening to your proposal, Yris sits down and slowly contemplates her options. \n\n[color=yellow]— This... would be quite a heavy penalty for such a loss, wouldn't it? But, I think I don’t have to many other options: you beat me at my own game, and I should accept this defeat. After all, you would be able to use me any day for not being satisfied this time and that's a fitting punishment for my loss. [/color]\n\nWhile it appears from her word choice that she's not very enthusiastic about it, you notice she in fact seems pretty happy with this outcome and is only trying to hide her true excitement. She stayed true to her nature and enjoyed every part of this game and how it played out even in her loss. "

N-not that big people terrify me or anything![/color]\n\nShe coughs and rubs one of her arms, clearly embarrassed.\n\n[color=yellow]- Well... Actually I moved to a nearby village, but I just can't learn the surroundings, and keep getting lost. I'm just not used to all this open… Openness.\n\n- Say, do you happen to know the road? Could you help me out?[/color]"
var ChloeEncounterRefuse = "- Oh, I see... Well, don't worry, I'll manage! Good luck then, see you around!\n\nSaying that, she quickly retreats, disappearing from sight."
var ChloeEncounterHelp = "[color=yellow]- Really?! Oh thank goodness, you’re a lifesaver, literally! My name’s Chloe by the way. Man am I glad I didn’t run away from you.[/color]\n\nShe seems genuinely relieved that you can show her the way.\n\n[color=yellow]- B-but don’t get me wrong, it’s not like tall people scare me or anything like that... A-anyway! We should really head back before it gets too dark.[/color]"
var ChloeEncounterRepeat = "- Oh, it's you again! Ugh... Yeah, I kinda forgot the road again. I should really start carrying around one of those absurd round things with the pointy dealy. Looks like you know the way better than I do, have you figured out the roads yet?"

It's nice that you actually came! It's kinda never occurred to me that you’re a mage before.\n\n- I'm not all that into magic myself, but I’ve found some use for it. Wanna make a deal? Provide me with some mana, and I can share a spell an old friend passed onto me during some experiments I was running at the time.\n\n- It lets you influence the target’s mind, letting you plant some serious suggestions. I’ve never really been into tweaking with other people minds, but you should have plenty of use for it. So how about it; 25 mana for the spell sound fair?[/color]"

I haven’t actually had the chance to use it before, but it should work. And, um… If you don’t mind, I can help out, I guess.\n\nDeciding to give her the lead, you follow Chloe over to a bench and take a seat. She carefully rubs at your groin, and with a surprised gasp, she frees your manhood, clearly intimidated by its size.\n\n[color=yellow]- I-I uh, guess it’s only natural that you’d be big in more ways than one...[/color]\n\nThe awkward little gnome takes hold of your penis, at first gently stroking your cock, and adjusting her hand movements and pressure to try and give you the most pleasure. Her innocence and cute looks are enough to keep you going, but it’s clear she won’t be getting you off with her lack of technique this way, a fact she seems quick to catch onto. With clear arousal and determination in her eyes, she adds her mouth into the mix.\n\nWith a hint of worship, the eager gnome dutifully attends to your throbbing member, stroking and sucking so you can reach orgasm much faster, and you’re more than happy to oblige her efforts. With each movement she becomes just a little more confident, acting more and more bold, and you realize she’s observing you; looking at every little reaction and learning your sweet spots.\n\nAs you’re about to cum, Chloe pulls your cock out of her mouth, pushes it into the device she brought out at the start, and finishes you off with her hand. Your orgrasm is no different from any other, but for once you feel yourself giving mana instead of taking it, as the device sucks the bounty into its storage.\n\nChloe gleams with joy, happily smiling as she runs off to put her new possession away.\n\n[color=yellow]- That will do... Now if you excuse me, I have some work on hand while it's fresh. Please, come again later![/color]\n\n[color=aqua]You have learned the Entrancement Spell.[/color]"

She is hardly recognisable, as she crawls half-naked, on the ground. She barely recognizes you, being semiconscious, moaning and blissfully rubbing her bare crotch.\n\n[color=yellow]- $name?... You found me... I want you... Please, I can't...

This makes you slightly worried, but a few nudges bring her back to consciousness\n\n[color=yellow]- We... should get out of here.[/color]\n\nNot wasting any more time, you help the still-woozy gnome to get out of the ravine and return with her back to the Shaliq."

Then I just couldn't think straight for days... I think there's also something in the air.\n\n- But that aside, I need your help. You see... I still can't calm down. It's not as bad as it was there, but I just can't concentrate on anything. I have a recipe for an antidote which should help. Can...can you make it for me? Please?

Um... how about this?[/color]\n\nShe spends some time looking through her stuff, until finally finds an old looking scroll.\n\n[color=yellow]- This is supposed to be a dangerous spell, but you helped me, and I think you would use it responsibly.

What was I doing again...[/color]\n\nAs the amnesia potion starts to take effect, Chloe appears to be less and less conscious of the world around her.

###Ayneris

var AynerisMeet1 = "As you travel on one of the footpaths, you sense the presence of a group of people nearby. Cautiously moving forward, you come across a group of armed elves, lead by a young, luxuriously dressed woman. Perhaps, too young, to be in command of such a group. Upon spotting you she instantly responds and yells to her guards.\n\n[color=yellow]— You! You’re the trespasser our peasants reported. You'll pay for disgrace you caused to them. Get him![/color]\n\nMany elven regions still utilize a feudal structure and it is likely that the girl is a member of a noble family responsible for this area. Despite your attempts to explain your presence and that they are mistaken, her squad is already moving to attack, leaving you little choice but to fight back."
var AynerisWin1 = "With her escort chased off or knocked unconscious, you are left with the subdued elven girl. Despite her arms and legs being tied and no clear way to escape she keeps struggling and showering you with anger.\n\n[color=yellow]— Let me go, you damn $race. You have no idea who you dared to attack! I'm Ayneris of the Stormbourn clan, you will pay for this! [/color]\n\nHer angry attempts to lord over you despite her current situation raises an urge to put her in her place."
var AynerisPunish1 = "You pick up the noisy Ayneris and lay her upon a fallen tree. Despite being bound and having no way to you, she continues to proclaim her protest though there is a note of concern in her voice now.You quickly gag her mouth to stop the raising irritation. With her butt presented, you lower her pants, exposing her bright skin to the forest's air. \n\nHer muffled swears quickly stop as you deliver a heavy slap to her ass. Slowly all the while delivering new spankings, you explain to her that she has mistaken you for someone else and this is her punishment for attacking an innocent bystander. With each slap she cries out through the gag, and even though her attitude seems to shift slightly, her eyes are still filled with anger when she looks at you. After another loud slap on her now bright red ass, you lower her pants even further and notice her pussy has become rather moist which puts a smirk on your face. Despite Ayneris having little strength left, she manages to give another protesting yelp and attempts to jerk away as your fingers carefully enter her. Another heavy slap calms her protests and she lets you examine her virgin hole.\n\nCaptivated by the sight, you spend more time massaging her labia and clit, while still giving playful slaps to her ass. Quickly her sobbed moans begin to change and start to sound more and more lewd. Having reinforced your position over the elven girl, you increase the pace of your ministrations, bringing her to a sudden shame filled orgasm. Wondering, if it's the correct thing to do, you loosen the bonds on her exhausted body and quickly leave, deciding she would bring too many trouble if taken with you."
var AynerisLeave = "You decide to leave elven girl and retreat before someone else shows up and takes the whole situation in the wrong manner. Being well-known around here, you expect her to be found rather soon anyway."
var AynerisMeet2 = "After making your way along another pathway, you encounter a familiar person: Ayneris, the noble elf girl you has previously encountered and defeated. This time her party is even larger and seem to be prepared for a fight."
var AynerisWin2 = "Once again elven soldiers were defeated and Ayneris lies tied up before you."
var AynerisPunish2 = "You decide that previous lesson needs an additional reinforcement and you quickly bring the struggling elf girl into a familiar position. With her naked butt in the air, Ayneris has no choice, but to be spanked like a naughty child for a second time. This time, however, you carefully watch over her private parts and spot how quickly she turns wet after you strike her just a couple times. Her face, currently way redder, than her ass, shows a signs of concern as she notices your dirty grin. \n\nSinking your fingers into her virgin pussy makes Ayneris involuntarily moans in pleasure. She quickly realizes her mistake and tries to struggle, but you pay that no attention and gently caress her labia contrasting it with rough slaps on her bum. Her quickly moistening crotch indicate how undoubtedly excited she is. You decide that this time you should punish her completely and not stop half-way through. Pulling your erect cock out causes Ayneris’ eyes to open wide in panic. She pleads with you not to do it as you line your cock up with her tight hole.\n\nAs you plow into her virgin elven pussy, the girl spasms with unintelligible scream before falling limp from the intense orgasm, fueled by excitement from the foreplay. You tell her, this time you will be compensated with pleasure from her side. Grabbing her waist from behind, you begin to fuck her defenseless body. The heightened sensitivity after her orgasm quickly overrides the pain caused by the loss of her virginity and to your surprise her moans quickly take on a familiar tone. After a brief consideration, you untie her legs and turn her onto her back, savoring her tear-soaked red face. A minor smear of blood coats your cock, indicating her loss of virginity. You give her a smug smile as you get closer to climax.\n\nRaising the pace, you notice how her moans suddenly change and her body trembles as you bring her to another involuntary orgasm. Right after that you pull out and shower her crotch with your cum. Ayneris's unfocused eyes seem to unable to grasp the situation, so once again you untie her and quickly leave the area."
var AynerisMeet3 = "After entering the local store, you spot a familiar figure, who instantly recognizes you. It is Ayneris, the elven girl of noble origins with whom you’ve had an interesting relationship, however, she appears to be alone this time. She quickly rushes at you raising her voice in anger. You quickly drag her outside to not attract any more unwanted attention. \n\n[color=yellow]— I can't believe you dared to show your face around here after what you did! [/color]\n\nShe takes a pause then her tone suddenly changes and she sounds like an angry child, who still wants something from her guardian. Her familiarity leads you to think, that your " + ' "discipline" ' + " has been taken unexpectedly positively. \n\n[color=yellow]— Actually, forget about it. I want to apologize for my past actions, if you let me. I know your name, $name, you are from the Mage's Order. I've learnt a bit about you after the last time. I want to join you. [/color]\n\nReacting with caution to her unexpected statement, you ask her to explain what's going on, before making any decisions.\n\n[color=yellow]— Well... you see, the Stormbourns have a lot of children and rather little in the way of possessions and wealth. I'm one of the younger generation and most of that is already claimed by my brothers. I thought, if I could prove that I'm capable of taking care of family's business and defending its people, I could at least achieve a better position, maybe take the place of one of my brothers. So after I had heard some rumors about a trespasser in one of our villages, I went to try catch him, but found you instead…\n\n— So my plan fell apart, as you know. Now I've decided to leave and see the world, since all is better than be kept around out of humility. I think I’ve proven myself capable of standing up to most in a fight and I can be of use to you, and if you don’t let me go with you  I'll yell so hard, that the guards will chase you all the way to the mountains![/color]"
var AynerisOfferJoin = "You figure out, that not letting Ayneris to join you is really not an option at this point, and cautiously invite her. \n\n[color=yellow]— Great! I'll be looking forward to my personal room![/color]\n\nWith slightly mischievous smile, Ayneris disappears through the portal. "
var AynerisIgnore = "With a cheap distracting trick you quickly retreat. Thankfully, you've managed to get lost in the crowd, before Ayneris could bring to much attention to you, but your reputation around Amberguard will surely suffer. "


#Sebastian

var sebastianumbra = "You explain to Sebastian, that you are looking for alternative options for selling slaves and wondering if he can help you make a few new connections.\n\n[color=yellow]— Looking for new options, pal? I suppose, I could take some troublesome slaves from you, but I will be straight up with you: I won't pay you much, also word about it will quickly spread and people won't be pleased. You don't care about your reputation? I might have another option for you, it will be difficult to arrange... Fine, I'll pass you an exclusive ticket. Just come see me once you have enough money.[/color]\n\n[color=aqua]You can sell slaves to Sebastian now. Slaves sold this way will grant upgrade points even if they are not tamed properly, but this will lower your reputation. [/color]"
var sebastianumbra2 = "After slipping the money to Sebastian, he quickly checks area for any possible witnesses  before passing you the teleport stone.\n\n[color=yellow]— Don't you dare tell anyone where you got this, I’ve just started to form a good reputation and I don't like my efforts going to waste. In Umbra you will encounter outcasts of every kind you can imagine and a whole bunch you can’t, so keep your eyes open. There's plenty of security and unwritten rules to keep the peace but given the nature of the place scuffles do break out on occasion.You should resist the temptation to visit any more than you need to. You will find plenty of opportunities there, but in case something happens I will deny any connections to you. Now, thanks for the business and good luck, $name. "
var UmbraFirstVisit = "You address one of the patrollers monitoring the area and responsible for keeping order, who is friendly enough to explain how things function. Umbra is open to almost everyone, regardless of what they might have done outside, as long as they behave and don't cause too much trouble. There are a  few personal access points through which you could get here in various slums, but otherwise there's no public information on where it is located, or who is in charge. There's also no hard rules, aside from no open aggression, but given kind of individuals coming here, you shouldn't expect not to be attacked. \n\nHe explains that you can send your slaves here for work with no real restraint, as slaves are seen as mere tools to be exploited for profit. They will be quickly disciplined and put into place if they dare to refuse their position.\n\nLastly, you get information on most relevant points of your interest: the black market, and the slave auction. Both populated in general by opportunists sometimes allowing you to find things you will rarely see anywhere else."

#Maple

var MapleFlirt = "[color=yellow]— I'm sorry, $name, but your proposal is against guild's rules. We are not permitted to get involved with customers. We are required to be professional at all times, and our employee policy is very strict... [/color]\n\nMaple pauses for a moment  breaking her usual down to business attitude and looks away thinking about something. She then continues with a slight change in  tone.[/color]\n\n[color=yellow]— On the other hand, you have been a great customer recently. If you are fine with a slightly unpleasant room, I'd love to thank you in person. [/color]\n\nAfter getting a silent agreement from you, she hastily leads you to an empty pantry. After looking down the hallway, she cautiously locks the door behind her.\n\n[color=yellow]— Alright, I shouldn't be needed there for another half hour or so. I'm sorry for this kind of a mess, but we are really not allowed to get intimate with customers... but I do want to please you.[/color]\n\nThe Fairy's tone became even more distinct from her usual attitude and makes you believe she is clearly doing this out of her personal admiration. She quickly jumps to your side, and after getting your permission to start, quickly kneels down before you facing your crotch. The lack of furnishing in the room gives you no choice but to stay standing leaning up against the wall, but it seems Maple had no problem with the uncomfortable position. \n\nAfter slowly revealing your already hard cock, fairy's face turns bright red as she smiles. Her tiny hands gently wrap around your cock. With care and hint of worship, she runs her hands up and down, bringing her mouth closer to the shaft. Slowly licking your cock, she makes sure her small mouth will be able to fit it. After giving you another passionate look, she somehow manages to fit your cock inside. Despite her actions being pretty awkward, her eagerness and tightness greatly make up for it. Feeling better and better with every minute, you help Maple to keep a steady pace by holding her head. After warning her about your approaching orgasm, she tells you to cum inside. As your semen gushes down the girl's throat, you notice how her eyes widen, but she does not choke, returning only satisfied moans. After carefully cleaning your cock of the last bits of semen, Maple finally manages to free her mouth.\n\n[color=yellow]— It would be hard to explain if my uniform got dirty. I hope you liked it. You should go first then. Come visit me later![/color]\n\nAfter a farewell kiss, Maple lets you leave the pantry. A few minutes she reappears at the reception looking happy as ever. "
var MapleFlirt2 = "[color=yellow]— I'm sorry, $name, but this is against... [/color]\n\nAfter looking around ensuring all is clear, the fairy whispers you to meet her in the same place as last time in 10 minutes.in 10 minutes to the same place you have been at last time. \n\nHaving barely closed the pantry's door behind you, Maple quickly jumps at you with a passionate kiss. Her serving attitude now also mixes with clear attraction of a lover. \n\n[color=yellow]— I hoped you wouldn't ask me again... But it's my duty to satisfy my favorite customer. [/color]\n\nSpewing this excuse she once again seals your lips letting you feel up her light body. Freeing her tiny tits from her clothing, you make the fairy girl release a couple of cute squeals. \n\n[color=yellow]— We shouldn't take too long, $name. Here, just use me as you want.[/color]\n\nMaple floats  into the air, positioning herself against the wall, presenting you her round bum. You tug at her shorts, pulling them down and revealing the clean white skin of her ass. As you free and push your member against Maple's crotch, she lets out a nervous pant, but gives you a sign to continue. To your own surprise, you have little problem penetrating the tiny girl's wet pussy, as it shows great elasticity. Fairy's blissful moan is quickly followed by her insides tightening around you. Without further delay you begin to move you cock in and out of her raw pussy, pressing her to the wall with each thrust. Despite her size and the force you apply to her, Maple moans with ecstasy getting closer to orgasm. You raise your speed at just in right moment, as she yelps and tightens over your cock. You have no option, but to follow up filling her climaxed body with hot seed.\n\nWith the naked fairy catching her breath on top of you, you suggest to Maple you would like it if she would consider joining you, but seeing her troubled expression, you do not expect a positive answer.\n\n[color=yellow]— As I've told you once before, I'm not for sale... But I'm not free to do anything either. I can't leave this place until I have fulfilled my contract. Sorry, I wish we could at least spend more time like this, but I really might get in trouble next time. [/color]\n\nAfter saying goodbye, you part ways and act in public as if nothing had happened. "
var MapleAudience = "After requesting an audience with the host of the slaver guild, you are lead through a pair of doors on the side of the receiving room and into an opulent office.  You briefly introduce yourself. The Host responds in a fairly friendly manner, given your status, be it your standing with the Mage Guild or the amount of money you’ve made him. Getting straight to the point he inquires about your business in requesting this meeting. Upon hearing you wished to purchase Maple's contract, he seems a bit taken back and gives you a surprised look, Composing himself, he explains, that her whole upbringing and education has been on credit and now she's obliged to work off that debt in service to the guild. He pulls a file from his cabinet and lets you examine the contract. You realise that the contract was made before she was even old enough to  make a reasonable informed decision. While the contract conditions may seem harsh they most likely saved her from a life on the streets and no education to build a future upon.\n\nThe total sum left to pay is nearly 4800 gold, and judging by Maple's income, it would take more than a decade for her to pay off the rest of it. She's not technically a slave, but she might as well be. Seeing your gloomed expression, the Host tells you, that since she's a diligent worker, and a popular guide, her leaving would be a big loss for guild plus he would have to train a new guide.. However, a large bag of gold at hand would be rather useful and allow for expansion. Given your patronage and hopefully further support as well as being  a respected person, he offers to sell you the contract for 7000 gold."
var MapleAudienceRepeat = "You can purchase Maple's contract for 7000 gold."
var MapleAudiencePurchase = "After sealing the deal, you receive Maple's contract."
var MapleTake = "You show to Maple your freshly purchased contract to which she reacts with shock and joy.\n\n[color=yellow]— Oh gosh, I'd never imagine someone would do this much for me! I'm so indebted to you now. [/color]\n\nYou let Maple leave and she joins your household."
