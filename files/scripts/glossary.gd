Your primary resources are: gold, food, and mana. Gold is required to buy items, train servants and upgrade your mansion. It is earned by assigning your servants to appropriate jobs, selling them to slaver's guild, by winning some encounters, and completing certain quests. Food is required for every person living in the mansion, including yourself. Not having enough food for your current population leads to servants (and prisoners) losing health and gaining stress. Food can be bought at the market, or acquired by servants assigned to the foraging or hunting jobs.\n\n Mana is the source of power for your spells and modifications to servants in the laboratory. It is generated by sexual activities you witness or participate in, and the amount gained varies depending on the attributes and skills of the involved characters. Energy determines how many actions you can take per day, such as interacting with servants, traveling, and fighting. When your energy is depleted, use 'Finish day' to advance time.\n\nOn the right side of the screen there is a list of your servants if you have any.
