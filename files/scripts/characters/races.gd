It is unknown whether Beastkin are man-made or the product of nature, as their spread and diversity often leads to inconsistent findings."
var halfkindescription = "Halfkin are the offspring produced by the union of a beastkin and a human. Halfkin most prominently display their human lineage, lacking fur and other major animalistic characteristics, but do possess secondary traits from their beastkin forebears, such as claws, ears, and tails, and tend to exhibit behavior from both parents equally.\n\nThe fate of halfkin varies from place to place, some living normally as any other race, others living under persecution and prejudice, and even rumors of far off lands where they are respected and worshipped. Regardless of what kind of environment they live in, halfkin are a popular item among collectors for their exotic appearance and the unique quality that their offspring will often swing back to fully human or fully beast."
